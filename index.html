"options": ["341", "342", "340", "339"],
"answerIndex": 2,
"explanation": "Let a be the first term and r be the common ratio. Then, ar^6 = 128 and ar^9 = 512. Dividing the second equation by the first, we get r^3 = 4. Thus, r = 2. Substituting into the first equation, we get a = 1. The sum of the first five terms is a(1 - r^5)/(1 - r) = 340."

"options": ["205", "196", "207", "198"],
"answerIndex": 1,
"explanation": "Let a be the first term and r be the common ratio. Then, a + ar + ar^2 = 21 and a(ar^2) = 54. Simplifying the second equation, we get ar = 6. Substituting into the first equation, we get a(1 + r + r^2) = 21. Dividing by ar, we get 1 + r + r^2 = 21/6 = 7/2. Multiplying by (r-1), we get r^3 - 1 = (7/2)(r-1). Solving for r, we get r = 2 or -1/2. Since the product of the first and third terms is positive, we must have r > 0. Thus, r = 2 and a = 1. The sum of the first five terms is a(1 - r^5)/(1 - r) = 196."

"explanation": "Let a be the first term and r be the common ratio. Then, ar^3 = 16/3 and ar^5 = 64/27. Dividing the second equation by the first, we get r^2 = 4/9. Thus, r = 2/3 or -2/3. Since the sixth term is positive, we must have r > 0. Thus, r = 2/3 and a = 3/4. The sum of the first six terms is a(1 - r^6)/(1 - r) = 108/13."

"answerIndex": 0,
"explanation": "The nth term of a GP is given by the formula: an = ar^(n-1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Using this formula, we can write two equations for the given problem: ar^2 = 12 and a*r^5 = 192. Dividing the second equation by the first equation, we get r^3 = 16, which means r = 2. Substituting this value in the first equation, we get a = 2. Therefore, the correct option is a=2, r=4."

Dividing the second equation by the first equation, we get r^5 = 33, which means r = 3. Substituting this value in the first equation, we get a = 1. Therefore, the correct option is a=1, r=3."
